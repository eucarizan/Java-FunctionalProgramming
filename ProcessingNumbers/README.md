# Processing numbers

## Description
Here you need to use one of the methods learned in this lesson to implement the `getStream` method that produces a stream containing **sorted unique numbers** that are strictly less than 100.

As the problem is not difficult and it has several solutions, you can try to solve it several times using different methods to consolidate your knowledge.

## Examples
**Sample Input:**
```console
40 100 50 30 60 110 40 70 120
```

**Sample Output:**
```console
30 40 50 60 70
```
