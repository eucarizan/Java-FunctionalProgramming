# Isograms

## Description
Here, you need to implement a method to check if the given word is an **isogram** that means that no letter of the alphabet occurs more than once in this word, consecutive or non-consecutive.

To make it easier to come up with a stream-based solution, we give you a hint: the number of unique characters in an isogram word is the same as the length of this word.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
stream
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
true
```

**Sample Input 2:**
```console
java
```

**Sample Output 2:**
```console
false
```

**Sample Input 3:**
```console
exclusionary
```

**Sample Output 3:**
```console
true
```
