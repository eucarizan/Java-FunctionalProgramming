# Absolute values

## Description
There is a program that should print the absolute values of given integer numbers. The program reads the numbers from the standard input and must print the result to the standard output (as a single string containing all the numbers).

You need to finish up the program by adding one or more `map` operations to fulfill the task.

If you forgot or didn't know, [an absolute value](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/absolute-value.html) means to remove any negative sign in front of a number and to think of all numbers as positive (or zero).

Please, take a look at our examples to understand the problem clear.

## Examples
