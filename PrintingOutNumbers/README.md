# Printing out numbers

## Description
There is a method named `printNumbers` that accepts a stream of numbers. You need to finish the implementation of the method so that it prints out n numbers starting from the `k`-th number. We suppose that the counting starts from 1 and each number must be printed on a new line.

## Examples
