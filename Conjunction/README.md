# Conjunction

## Description
It is time to learn how to perform operations with predicates, just like in mathematical logic!

You need to implement the `conjunctAll` method that accepts a list of `IntPredicate` objects and returns one composed `IntPredicate`. This predicate must be a **conjunction** of all the input predicates, i.e. it returns `true` only if the input predicates return `true`, otherwise it must be `false`.

If the input list is empty, the resulted predicate must return `true` for any integer value (it is also known as **always true predicate**).
