# Generating users

## Description
You need to implement a method named `generateUsers` that generates the specified number of users. A user has an `id` and an `email`, and the values of these fields must be unique among the generated users (without duplicates).

If any users have the same `id` or `email`, the tests will fail.

Please, apply one of the methods you've learned in this lesson to solve the problem.

## Examples
**Sample Input**
```console
3
```

**Sample Output**
```console
1 user1@gmail.com
2 user2@gmail.com
3 user3@gmail.com
```
