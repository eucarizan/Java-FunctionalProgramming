# Your own binary function

## Description
Here you need to develop a functional interface that represents a binary function that can accept two generic arguments and produce a generic result.

1. The order of the generic parameters must be the following: `argument1`, `argument2`, `result`.
2. The single abstract method of this interface must be named `apply`.
3. Don't forget about adding the special annotation for the interface.

Please, don't make the interface `public`, otherwise the platform testing system won't work.

Just for your information, there is a standard analogue of this interface called `BiFunction`.
