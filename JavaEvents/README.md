# Java Events

## Description
Here you need to implement the `printSortedJavaEvents` method that takes a list of event titles and must print only the names of Java-related events in the alphabetical order.

An event is considered a Java-related if it contains the substring `"Java"` in the title. It is important that this substring can be written in any case: `"java"`, `"Java"`, `"JAVA"`, etc, and they all must count.

## Examples
**Sample Input:**
```console
JavaZone
KotlinConf
java night party | Amsterdam
Day of Java
PyCon US
```

**Sample Output:**
```console
Day of Java
JavaZone
java night party | Amsterdam
```
